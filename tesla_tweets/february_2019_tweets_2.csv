1096289675889782785,2019-02-15,01:06:41,I agree that for TSLA that's been true thus far. I've even done it. Not sure I'd elevate that to a general investment principle though.
1096286631974191104,2019-02-15,00:54:35,will FSD be capable navigating without lane markings? i understand $TSLA has the biggest training dataset for ML and it will only accumulate exponentially as more cars are produced. but i’m still having a hard time imagining my MX fully autonomous during #SeattleSnowpocalypse 😎 pic.twitter.com/IXVCyzumvG
