1161031366097678336,2019-08-12,17:47:03,xavierveys,Might just be from the high temperature + supercharging and driving that the cooling is diverted more to the battery and so less cooling power to AC. If you leave your car out for a while to cool down the system it will normally go away. Was the reduced AC uncomfortable?

In a Tesla you can easily do that and even drive upto 4 - 5 hours really before stopping. I guess you have to ask how long before you need to stop and if 60 minute break is ok
